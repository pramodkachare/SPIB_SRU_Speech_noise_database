# Signal Processing Information Base (SPIB) noise database
A repository of different noises measured in the field by the Speech Research Unit (SRU) at the Institute for Perception-TNO, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Project number: 2589-SAM, Feb. 1990) for signal processing researchers and application engineers.  Each file has a duration of **235 seconds** and was sampled at **19.98 kHz** with **16-bit resolution**, using an anti-aliasing filter and without a pre-emphasis stage.

- **White noise:** Acquired by sampling a high-quality analog noise generator (Wandel & Goltermann), which results in equal energy per Hz bandwidth.

- **Pink noise:** Acquired by sampling a high-quality analog noise generator (Wandel & Goltermann), yielding equal energy per 1/3 octave.

- **Babble noise:** Acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The source of this babble is 100 people speaking in a canteen. The room radius is over two meters; therefore, individual voices are slightly audible. The sound level during the recording process was 88 dBA.

- **Factory floor noise-1:** Acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). This noise was recorded near plate-cutting and electrical welding equipment.

- **Factory floor noise-2:** Acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). This noise was recorded in a car production hall.

- **Cockpit noise-1:**  Acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The Buccaneer jet was moving at a speed of 190 knots, and an altitude of 1000 feet, with airbrakes out. The sound level during the recording process was 109 dBA.

- **Cockpit noise-2:** Acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The Buccaneer was moving at a speed of 450 knots, and an altitude of 300 feet. The sound level during the recording process was 116 dBA.

- Cockpit Noise 3 (F-16) acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The noise was recorded at the co-pilot's seat in a two-seat F-16, traveling at a speed of 500 knots, and an altitude of 300-600 feet. The sound level during the recording process was 103 dBA. It was found that the flight condition had only a minor effect on the noise and, therefore, the reproduced noise can be considered to be representative.
Engine Room Noise (Destroyer) acquired by recording samples from microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The sound level during the recording process was 101 dBA.
Operations Room Background Noise (Destroyer) acquired by recording samples from microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The sound level during the recording process was 70 dBA.
Military Vehicle Noise (Leopard) acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The Leopard 1 vehicle was moving at a speed of 70 km/h. The sound level during the recording process was 114 dBA.
Military Vehicle Noise (M109) acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The M109 tank was moving at a speed of 30 km/h. The sound level during the recording process was 100 dBA.
Machine Gun Noise acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The weapon used was a .50 calibre gun fired repeatedly.
Vehicle Interior Noise (Volvo 340) acquired by recording samples from 1/2" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). This recording was made at 120 km/h, in 4th gear, on an asphalt road, in rainy conditions.
HF Channel Noise acquired from an HF radio channel after demodulation.
