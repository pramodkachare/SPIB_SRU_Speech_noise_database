# Signal Processing Information Base (SPIB) noise database
A repository of different noises measured in the field by the Speech Research Unit (SRU) at the Institute for Perception-TNO, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Project number: 2589-SAM, Feb. 1990) for signal processing researchers and application engineers.  Each file has a duration of **235 seconds** and was sampled at **19.98 kHz** with **16-bit resolution**, using an anti-aliasing filter and without a pre-emphasis stage.

- **White noise:** High-quality analog noise generator (Wandel & Goltermann) with equal energy per Hz bandwidth.

- **Pink noise:** High-quality analog noise generator (Wandel & Goltermann) with equal energy per 1/3 octave.

- **Babble noise:** 100 people speaking in a canteen with a room radius of over two meters and a 1/2" B&K condenser microphone. Individual voices are slightly audible. The sound level during the recording was 88 dBA.

- **Factory floor noise-1:** Near plate-cutting and electrical welding equipment noise recorded using a 1/2" B&K condensor microphone.

- **Factory floor noise-2:** Car production hall noise recorded using a 1/2" B&K condensor microphone.

- **Cockpit noise-1:**  Buccaneer jet moving at a speed of 190 knots, and an altitude of 1000 feet, with airbrakes out. The sound was recorded using a 1/2" B&K condenser microphone at 109 dBA.

- **Cockpit noise-2:** Buccaneer jet moving at a speed of 450 knots, and an altitude of 300 feet, with airbrakes out. The sound was recorded using a 1/2" B&K condenser microphone at 116 dBA.

- **Cockpit noise-3:** Recorded at the co-pilot's seat in a two-seat F-16, traveling at a speed of 500 knots and an altitude of 300-600 feet. The sound was recorded using a  1/2" B&K condenser microphone at 103 dBA. Flight condition had only a minor effect on the noise.

- **Engine room noise:** Recorded using a microphone at 101 dBA.

- **Operations room background noise:**  Destroyer room noise recorded using a microphone at 70 dBA.

- **Military vehicle noise:** The Leopard vehicle was moving at a speed of 70 km/h. Noise recorded using a 1/2" B&K condenser microphone at 114 dBA.

- **Military vehicle noise:** The M109 tank was moving at a speed of 30 km/h. Noise recorded using a 1/2" B&K condenser microphone at 100 dBA.

- **Machine gun noise:** A .50 calibre gun fired repeatedly. Noise recorded using a 1/2" B&K condenser microphone.

- **Vehicle interior noise:** Volvo 340 was moving at 120 km/h, in 4th gear, on an asphalt road, in rainy conditions. Recorded using a 1/2" B&K condenser microphone.

- **HF channel noise:** An HF radio channel after demodulation.
